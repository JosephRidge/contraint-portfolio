# Objective :
* Implement simple Koltin application that highlights more on the use of Constraint Layout, collections and Simple Kotlin logic operations and screen size responsiveness
* 
## Preparation :
To be able to use it we need to addd the following:
*  implementation 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.1.3'* // already added by default
*  maven.google.com in settings.gradel 
*   
## Update highlighted on creating applications that can work on multiple screen sized devices :
 To achieve this the following steps were taken :
 - navigate to the res directory , right click and select new > android resource file
 - Once done a pop up form will appear, set the following sections :
    - Resource Type : Layout
    - qualifier : Size
    - select screen target size once selected size ( small , normal, large,  xlarge)
